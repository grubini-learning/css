# Ordering

By default flexbox arranges its items based on DOM order. But, we can tweak the natural order.

## Possible ways

1. `flex-direction`: we are changing the direction of the axis, so other properties get affected as well.

   - `row-reverse`
   - `column-reverse`

2. `flex-order`

3. `flex-wrap`: elements wrap upwards instead
   - `wrap-reverse`
