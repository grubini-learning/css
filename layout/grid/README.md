# Grid

## Default

_Implicit Grid_: Comes up with its own grid layout based on the number of HTML children it has, creating 1 row per child.

- They want to fill all the available space.
- If, we give our grid a specific height, each element is divided equally to get the specified height of the grid
- How tall will these rows be? By default, they grow and shrink as-needed, based on the children.

## Miscellaneous
