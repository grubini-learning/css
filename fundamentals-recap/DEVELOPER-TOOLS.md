# Developer Tools

- we can use comments to still have css be part of the document.
  - Ex: try different colors

## Styles Tab

- force element state
- colors
  - `shift + click` - cycles through color formats
  - click and get a color wheel with the color contrast
- Information: if we use a css property that depends on another, and that dependency is unmet then we will know about it
