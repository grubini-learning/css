# Typography

## Font Families

Each family contains different sets that can have more weight, italic, and bold.

- Serif: contains a little adornment at the edge of the strokes

## Font stack

The idea that the browser will use the first font available from the comma separated list that we specify.

## Web Fonts

We can use fonts online and include them in our project different ways.

- Ex: through a third party hosting service

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```
